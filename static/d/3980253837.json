I implemented the minimax algorithm with alpha/beta pruning. Minimax is a decision rule used in artificial intelligence, decision theory, game theory, statistics for minimizing the possible loss for a worst case (maximum loss) scenario. Can you beat this AI ? Let's give it a try !","iframe":"//baptiste-monpezat.github.io/tic_tac_toe_minimax","src":"//github.com/baptiste-monpezat/tic_tac_toe_minimax","title":"Tic Tac Toe with Minimax Algorithm"},"fields":{"slug":"/case-studies/tic-tac-toe-with-minimax-algorithm"}}},{"node":{"id":"2709e3a0-0570-58fe-937b-b2e6b443f4dd","frontmatter":{"demo":"//baptiste-monpezat.github.io/handsign_challenge/","excerpt":"Do you know the TikTok hand signs challenge ? The challenge tasks participants to copy a list of hand emojis that appear on your screen. This app uses a neural network to predict hand signs from your camera and checks that you correctly copy the list of emojis.","iframe":"//www.youtube.com/embed/1vuJaDg2HZM","src":"//github.com/baptiste-monpezat/handsign_challenge","title":"Hand Sign Challenge using React and Tensorflow ‚úåüèº"},"fields":{"slug":"/case-studies/hand-sign-challenge-using-react-and-tensorflow"}}},{"node":{"id":"04382314-f5f4-53fc-9bdb-882a0221cf6e","frontmatter":{"demo":"//baptiste-monpezat.github.io/twitter-hashtags/","excerpt":"How to deal with live streaming data ? I built a streaming pipeline with spark that processes live tweets coming from the twitter api.The stream processing extracts hashtags from tweets and count them in a 10 minutes window. The count is then sent to the front-end to visualize Hashtags top trends.Doing this project, I learned a lot about spark, docker as well as nginx for web proxy.","iframe":"//www.youtube.com/embed/JcWxyNYIgsM","src":"//github.com/baptiste-monpezat/pyspark-twitter-stream","title":"Twitter Hashtags top trends with Spark Streaming."},"fields":{"slug":"/case-studies/twitter-hashtags-top-trends-with-spark-streaming"}}}]}}}
