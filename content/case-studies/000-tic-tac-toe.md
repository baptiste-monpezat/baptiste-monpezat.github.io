title: Tic Tac Toe with Minimax Algorithm
excerpt: This project consisted in developing a Tic Tac Toe in React. I implemented the minimax algorithm with alpha/beta pruning. Minimax is a decision rule used in artificial intelligence, decision theory, game theory, statistics for minimizing the possible loss for a worst case (maximum loss) scenario. Can you beat this AI ? Let's give it a try !
